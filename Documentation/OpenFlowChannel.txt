OpenFlow channel is used to exchange OpenFlow messages between  an openflow switch and openflow controller.
This is a communication medium between OF switch and OF Controller.

OF Controller must be able to accept connections from one or more switches over TCP/IP connectivity.
If switch is connected to multiple controllers, then one of the switch controllers will as Master and all others will act as either as slave or equal.

OF controller should accept connections from switches over TCP/IP usinf default port or user defined port.
connection can be TCP or TLS(optional)

Default OF port = 6653 by IANA

When controller wants to change its role, it should form role request message(OFPT_ROLE_REQUEST) and send the message to switch and should wait for role_reply message(OFPT_ROLE_REPLY). if the role value in reply message is equal, role of the controller is changed successfully.
